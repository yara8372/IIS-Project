# IIS-Project: Group Project part of Intelligent Interactive System Course at Uppsala University, Sweden.

Project Description: The project explores different mechanisms to make hand gestures efficient for the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset. The two methods adopted were: Part - 1: Landmark Extraction and Gesture Recognition, and Part - 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Both parts achieve the objective of ASL detection through Computer Vision, with the former being a part-wise foundational approach and the latter being an end-to-end specialization approach.
